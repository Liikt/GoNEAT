# GoNEAT

This little project will be a implentation of a HyperNEAT network. 
This project has been heavily inspired by Sethblings [MarI/O](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qv6UVOQ0F44).

## TODOs

* [x] Finish the CPPN
* [x] Write the code for the substrate
* [ ] Write the code for the player
* [ ] Write the code for the framework
* [ ] Test the network on Tic Tac Toe
* [ ] Write a general interface for more games and different substrate variations
